 <h1>Movies That Move Me</h1>
<h2>These are 3 top tier movies.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Labrynth</h3>
<p>The Labrynth is a funny adventure filled with excitement, tension, and an inexplicable sense of danger around every corner. 
    David Bowie's role as the Goblin King is captivating and smart. The puppeteering in this production is impressive and clean.</p>

<h3>The Princess Bride</h3>
<p>The Princess Bride is a prime example of story telling done right. 
    With danger around every corner, the movie will leave new viewers 
    on the edge of their seats and old viewers continuing to come back for more. 
</p>
<h3>(Don't) Look Up</h3>
<p>(Don't) Look Up is a gripping commentary on the passiveness people have 
    towards very real and present dangers that threaten their lives. The movie 
     presents to the viewer an impending disaster, kept under wraps by billionaire elites
      and government officials hoping to stave off panic at the expense of preventing people 
      from being present in the moment and have the potential to make a difference.
      This movie is a reflection of the modern day as it would take very little to 
      see the consistencies between reality and science-based fiction.
